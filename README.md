### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My goal is to develop systems that benefit both businesses and users. I strive to write clean and structured code, actively utilize new technologies and tools to solve problems, and refer to documentation, StackOverflow, and use GPT chat to find optimal solutions during learning and project work.
