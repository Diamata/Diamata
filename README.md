### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Diana**, I'm a **frontend developer** in search of a job! 

**My stack:** 
React, SASS, TypeScript, Redux, but Iâ€™m always glad to explore and master other technologies. 
I strive to become part of a friendly and professional team in which I could implement and develop my development skills. 

I've relocated to Belgrade, Serbia and I am in search of a  job (preferably remote). Also, Iâ€™m considering working as an entrepreneur.

My skills from previous areas of employment - 3D modeling and photo retouching - will help in the competent building of the user interface, perseverance, attentiveness, the desire to grow professionally and to bring benefits for the team will be a good help in solving the tasks, and friendliness and courtesy will contribute to maintaining a positive atmosphere in the team.

Thanks for your time and attention! 
Let's continue our acquaintance in [Telegram](https://t.me/Dianosaurum), WhatsApp or Viber: +7-969-284-30-31, or in any other more convenient way.
